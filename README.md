# Matrix-Calculator

This is the Matrix Solve Project. 15112 Term Project by Tianze (Steven) Shou. 

This project is a matrix calculate, which helps user to conduct basic matrix operations (e.g., addition, multiplication...). Users can also find the more advanced features, such as solving a linear system, reducing a matrix to row-echelon form, and finding eigen-values eigen-vectors, to be useful. 

To run the program, simply go to the Code folder and run 'Interface.py'. You can enter your customized matrices to the fields under 'A', 'B', and 'C'. Enter your mathematical expression on the field to the middle, then press ENTER to calculate.

To smoothly run the program, numpy and PIL will have to be install on your computer. 


Some commands that you may find useful: 
det(A): find the determinant of Matrix A 
Ax=B: solve for unknown variable x with coefficient Matrices A and B 
RREF(A): reducing A to row-echelon form 
LU(A): conduct LU or PTLU factorization on Matrix A
eigen(A): find eigen-values and eigen-vectors of A
